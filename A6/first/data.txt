MapReduce  is  a  programming  model  for  writing applications  that  can  process  Big Data  in  parallel  on  multiple  nodes.  MapReduce  provides  analytical  capabilities  for analyzing huge volumes of complex data.What is Big Data?Big Data is a collection of large datasets that cannot be processed using traditional computing techniques. For example, the volume of data Facebook or YouTubeneed require it to collect and manage on a daily basis, can fall under the category of Big Data. However, Big Data is not only about scale and volume, it also involves one or more of the following aspects âˆ’ Velocity, Variety, Volume, and Complexity.Why MapReduce?Traditional  Enterprise  Systems  normally  have  a  centralized  server  to  store  and process  data.  The  following  illustration  depicts  a  schematic  view  of  a  traditional enterprise system. Traditional model is certainly not suitable to process huge volumes of  scalable  data  and  cannot  be  accommodated  by  standard  database  servers. Moreover, the centralized system creates too much of a bottleneck while processing multiple files simultaneously.
